### NZBGET QUEUE/POST-PROCESSING SCRIPT                                    ###

# Detect nzbs with fake media files.
#
# If a fake is detected the download is marked as bad. NZBGet removes
# the download from queue and (if option "DeleteCleanupDisk" is active) the
# downloaded files are deleted from disk. If duplicate handling is active
# (option "DupeCheck") then another duplicate is chosen for download
# if available.
#
# The status "FAILURE/BAD" is passed to other scripts and informs them
# about failure.
#
# PP-Script version: 1.7.
#
# For more info and updates please visit forum topic at
# http://nzbget.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=1394.
#
# NOTE: This script requires Python3.8 to be installed on your system
